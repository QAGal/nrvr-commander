# NrvrCommander - Repository README

NrvrCommander is a Python package for devops and QA automation around
virtual machines, VMware, Enterprise Linux 6.x, and more.

If you got this from the source repository
(at [github](https://github.com/srguiwiz/nrvr-commander))
and just want to use it, run **./installlocally.py**.

For what is provided in the package, see **src/README.txt**.

Other than src/, files in dev/ are NOT going into the Python package.

One good example file showing off a lot of utility is
**dev/examples/makeavm001.py**.

Even though at first made and maybe most useful with a certain brand Linux,
and a certain brand machine virtualization,
code here is useful for automation with other operating systems,
physical machines, etc.
