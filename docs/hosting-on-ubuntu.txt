Remember to run installlocally.py.

NrvrCommander is capable of telling which commands it needs on the host.

Reasonably well known to run on:
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (specifically tested on 12.04.03), 64-bit
* Ubuntu 13.04, 64-bit

For many features needs VMware Player and VMware VIX API (vmrun),
for some features needs VMware Workstation (comes with vmrun).

Assuming VMware 9 or newer.  VMware 10 is supported.

To install needed libraries:

sudo apt-get install libcdio-utils

Possibly more to be listed here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When libcdio version 0.92 comes to Ubuntu, this should be it.
End of host platform specific instructions.

Here is a workaround you will need meanwhile:

As a problem that is going away with libcdio 0.92, there has been a known
problem with .iso files not being read correctly by the version of iso-read
(from package libcdio-utils) installed by Ubuntu at least 12.04 to 13.04,
that version being 0.83.

More about that in an enclosed text file on that topic.

Here are instructions how to build a specific newer version iso-read that is
known to work well with NrvrCommander, from the git repository of libcdio:

sudo apt-get -y install git
#
sudo apt-get -y install automake
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential
sudo apt-get -y install autoconf
sudo apt-get -y install libtool
sudo apt-get -y install texinfo
#
cd ~/Downloads
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/libcdio.git
cd libcdio
git checkout release-0.92
#
sh ./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-shared CFLAGS='-fno-inline -g' --enable-maintainer-mode
make
sudo make install
