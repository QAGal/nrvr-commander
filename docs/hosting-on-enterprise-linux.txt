NrvrCommander is capable of telling which commands it needs on the host.

Assuming RHEL 6.x or newer or a derivative (CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc.).

For many features needs VMware Player and VMware VIX API (vmrun),
for some features needs VMware Workstation (comes with vmrun).

Assuming VMware 9 or newer.

To install needed libraries:

sudo yum install libcdio
sudo yum install genisoimage
sudo yum install qemu-img

Possibly more to be listed here.

There is a known problem with .iso files >4G not being read correctly,
which means the example given won't make Scientific Linux 64-bit,
but making 64-bit guests is known to work otherwise.
Hoping for solution via http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?39373 before trying other fix.
