Remember to run installlocally.py.

NrvrCommander is capable of telling which commands it needs on the host.

Should run on RHEL 6.x or newer, 64-bit,
or a derivative (CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc.), 64-bit.

Reasonably well known to run on:
* Scientific Linux 6.4, 64-bit

For many features needs VMware Player and VMware VIX API (vmrun),
for some features needs VMware Workstation (comes with vmrun).

Assuming VMware 9 or newer.  VMware 10 is supported.

To install needed libraries:

sudo yum install libcdio
sudo yum install genisoimage
sudo yum install qemu-img

Possibly more to be listed here.

When libcdio version 0.91 comes to RHEL, this should be it.
End of host platform specific instructions.
Below is additional information you may or may not need meanwhile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a temporary nuisance that should go away sooner or later, there has
been a known problem with .iso files >4GB not being read correctly by the
version 0.81 of iso-read (from package libcdio) installed by RHEL 6.x.

More about that in an enclosed text file on that topic.

That nuisance means, in case your were trying to, examples haven't easily been
making Scientific Linux 6.x, 64-bit, which comes on a distro .iso file >4GB.

Instructions how to build a newer version iso-read that is known to work well
with NrvrCommander, from the git repository of libcdio, for RHEL 6.x, could be
written similarly to an enclosed text file on hosting on Ubuntu.
