NrvrCommander is capable of telling which commands it needs on the host.

Assuming RHEL 6.x or newer or a derivative (CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc.).

For many features needs VMware Player and VMware VIX API (vmrun),
for some features needs VMware Workstation (comes with vmrun).

Assuming VMware 9 or newer.

To install needed libraries:

sudo yum install libcdio
sudo yum install genisoimage
sudo yum install qemu-img

Possibly more to be listed here.

As a temporary nuisance that is about to go away, there has been a
known problem with .iso files >4G not being read correctly,
which means the example given wasn't making Scientific Linux 64-bit,
but making 64-bit guests is known to work otherwise.
Since 2013-09-15 there is a fix in the git master branch of libcdio,
which provides iso-read.
Should make it into the next release of libcdio, i.e. newer than version 0.90.
