Remember to run installlocally.py.

NrvrCommander is capable of telling which commands it needs on the host.

Should run on RHEL 6.x or newer, 64-bit,
or a derivative (CentOS, Scientific Linux, etc.), 64-bit.

Reasonably well known to run on:
* Scientific Linux 6.4, 64-bit

For many features needs VMware Player and VMware VIX API (vmrun),
for some features needs VMware Workstation (comes with vmrun).

Assuming VMware 9 or newer.  VMware 10 is supported.

To install needed libraries:

sudo yum install libcdio
sudo yum install genisoimage
sudo yum install qemu-img

Possibly more to be listed here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When libcdio version 0.92 comes to RHEL, this should be it.
End of host platform specific instructions.

Here is a workaround you may need meanwhile:

As a problem that is going away with libcdio 0.92, there has been a known
problem with .iso files >4GB not being read correctly by version 0.81 of
iso-read (from package libcdio) installed by RHEL 6.x.
Also that older version cannot read Windows .iso files.

More about that in an enclosed text file on that topic.

That problem means, on RHEL 6.x, examples haven't been installing Scientific
Linux 6.x, 64-bit, which comes on a distro .iso file >4GB.
It also prevents installing Windows.

Here are instructions how to build a specific newer version iso-read that is
known to work well with NrvrCommander, from the git repository of libcdio:

sudo yum -y install git
#
sudo yum -y install make
sudo yum -y install autoconf
sudo yum -y install automake
sudo yum -y install libtool
sudo yum -y install m4
sudo yum -y install texinfo
sudo yum -y install help2man
sudo yum -y install gcc-c++
#
cd ~/Downloads
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/libcdio.git
cd libcdio
git checkout release-0.92
#
sh ./autogen.sh
./configure --disable-shared CFLAGS='-fno-inline -g' --enable-maintainer-mode
make
#
touch src/cd-drive.1
touch src/cd-info.1
touch src/cd-read.1
touch src/iso-read.1
touch src/iso-info.1
#
sudo make install
