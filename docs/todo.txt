TODOs:

This to-do list may be outdated and less relevant.

src/nrvr/process/commandcapture.py could use more testing
(automated and semi-manual) with the help of sleeper.py,
similar to what has been coded in subprocessexperiment.py.
Be aware of the unpredictable order of lines from different streams:
E.g. stdout and stderr could come with different interleaving.
