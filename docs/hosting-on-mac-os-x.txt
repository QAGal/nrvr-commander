NrvrCommander is capable of telling which commands it needs on the host.

Assuming Mac OS X 10.8 or newer.

For many features needs VMware Fusion (comes with vmrun).

Assuming VMware Fusion 5 or newer.

To have vmrun and vmware-vdiskmanager on command line per
http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vix-api/vix112_vmrun_command.pdf
do (but without \ they had on that page)
export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library"
or even better edit file ~/.profile to have that line.

To install needed libraries:

Install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

Then:

sudo port install libcdio
sudo port install cdrtools
sudo port install qemu

Possibly more to be listed here.

Following these steps in OS X currently iso-read cannot read the SL-6*.iso files
used in some examples.  Solution provided here.

As discussed http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?39354 there is a problem with libcdio 0.90.

Hence install older version libcdio 0.81 per
http://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/InstallingOlderPort
sudo port uninstall libcdio
then using
http://trac.macports.org/log/trunk/dports/devel/libcdio
and
http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/devel/libcdio/Portfile?rev=41757
mkdir ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port
mv ~/Downloads/Portfile ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/
sudo chown -R macports:macports ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/Portfile
cd ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/
sudo port install
may fail with
Error: Unable to execute port: Could not open file: ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/Portfile
per various postings probably a permission problem, not same but
similar to http://trac.macports.org/ticket/38472
found workaround
sudo mkdir /tmp-make-port
sudo cp ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/Portfile /tmp-make-port/
sudo chown macports:macports /tmp-make-port
cd /tmp-make-port
sudo port install
cd ~
sudo rm -rf /tmp-make-port
check with
iso-read --version

There is a known problem with .iso files >4G not being read correctly,
which means the example given won't make Scientific Linux 64-bit,
but making 64-bit guests is known to work otherwise.
Hoping for solution via http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?39373 before trying other fix.
