Remember to run installlocally.py.

NrvrCommander is capable of telling which commands it needs on the host.

Assuming Mac OS X 10.8 or newer.

For many features needs VMware Fusion (comes with vmrun).

Assuming VMware Fusion 5 or newer.

To have vmrun and vmware-vdiskmanager on command line per
http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vix-api/vix112_vmrun_command.pdf
do (but without \ they had on that page)
export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library"
or even better edit file ~/.profile to have that line.

To install needed libraries:

Install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/ .

Then:

sudo port install libcdio
sudo port install cdrtools
sudo port install qemu

Possibly more to be listed here.

When libcdio version 0.91 comes to MacPorts, this should be it.
End of host platform specific instructions.
Below is a workaround you will need meanwhile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alas, following these steps, in OS X at the time of this writing the version of iso-read
installed via MacPorts, that version being 0.90, cannot read common distro .iso files
used in examples, and presumbly needed for real use of NrvrCommander.

More about that in an enclosed text file on that topic.

Meanwhile, one possible workaround is provided here.

To see your version enter:

iso-read --version

If 0.90 then, for now only, install an older version libcdio 0.81 per instructions:

http://trac.macports.org/wiki/howto/InstallingOlderPort

First:

sudo port uninstall libcdio

Then using a Portfile downloaded from:

http://trac.macports.org/log/trunk/dports/devel/libcdio
http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/devel/libcdio/Portfile?rev=41757

Try:

mkdir ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port
mv ~/Downloads/Portfile ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/
sudo chown -R macports:macports ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/Portfile
cd ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/
sudo port install

It may fail with:

Error: Unable to execute port: Could not open file: ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/Portfile

Per various postings found this is probably a permission problem. Not the same but
similar to http://trac.macports.org/ticket/38472 found workaround:

sudo mkdir /tmp-make-port
sudo cp ~/Downloads/libcdio-81-port/Portfile /tmp-make-port/
sudo chown macports:macports /tmp-make-port
cd /tmp-make-port
sudo port install
cd ~
sudo rm -rf /tmp-make-port

Check with:

iso-read --version

This has been done and has been in continuous use for some time, for making a
number of Linux machines, mostly 32-bit.

If, however, you would want to work with a distro .iso file >4GB, e.g. for
making Scientific Linux 6.x, 64-bit machines, then ...

instructions how to build a newer version iso-read that is known to work well
with NrvrCommander, from the git repository of libcdio, for RHEL 6.x, could be
written similarly to an enclosed text file on hosting on Ubuntu ...

if someone would bother to do so, correctly, after figuring it out.  Might be
better off pushing for a release of a libcdio version 0.91.
