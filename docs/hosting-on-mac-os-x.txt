Remember to run installlocally.py.

NrvrCommander is capable of telling which commands it needs on the host.

Assuming Mac OS X 10.8 or newer.

For many features needs VMware Fusion (comes with vmrun).

Assuming VMware Fusion 5 or newer.

To have vmrun and vmware-vdiskmanager on command line per
http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vix-api/vix112_vmrun_command.pdf
do (but without \ they had on that page)
export PATH="$PATH:/Applications/VMware Fusion.app/Contents/Library"
or even better edit file ~/.profile to have that line.

To install needed libraries:

Install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/ .

In case MacPorts had been installed earlier, make sure libcdio is at least 0.92:

sudo port selfupdate
sudo port upgrade outdated

Then:

sudo port install libcdio
sudo port install cdrtools
sudo port install qemu
sudo port install wget

Possibly more to be listed here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since libcdio version 0.92 is in MacPorts, this should be it.
End of host platform specific instructions.
