NrvrCommander for some functionality invokes iso-read.

Version 0.81 of iso-read has worked reasonably well,
specifically if and because most .iso files are <4GB.

Version 0.91 of iso-read hopefully will work reasonably well,
for any size .iso files, even >4GB.

Versions 0.83 to 0.90 of iso-read are known not to work for NrvrCommander,
not for any size .iso files, neither small nor large.

To see your version enter:

iso-read --version

The iso-read and iso-info command line utilities come from the
"Compact Disc Input and Control Library" often packaged as "libcdio",
but also as "libcdio-utils", and available in distros.

RHEL 6.x and derivatives so far have provided version 0.81,
hence much use of NrvrCommander has been without problems,
specifically if and because most .iso files are <4GB.
One exception has been one distro .iso file >4GB.

Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.04 apparently provide version 0.83,
See the enclosed Ubuntu specific documentation file for instructions
how to build from the git repository of libcdio.

MacPorts for Mac OS X at the time of this writing apparently
provides version 0.90.
See the enclosed Mac OS X specific documentation file for instructions
how to downgrade to version 0.81.

A version of libcdio source code that is known to work well with NrvrCommander
can be retrieved be checking out commit 9c9f9d0 from 2013-09-26, like so:

git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/libcdio.git
cd libcdio
git checkout 9c9f9d0
sed -i -e 's/VERSION_STR,[^)]*/VERSION_STR, 0.$1.git9c9f9d0/' configure.ac
