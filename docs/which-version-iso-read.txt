NrvrCommander for some functionality invokes iso-read.

A relatively new version 0.92 of iso-read works reasonably well,
for any size .iso files, even >4GB.

A relatively old version 0.81 [sic] of iso-read has worked reasonably well,
specifically if and because many .iso files are <4GB.
That old version was for reading Linux distro .iso files only, it was
not working for Windows installer .iso files.

Versions 0.83 to 0.90 of iso-read are known not to work for NrvrCommander,
not for any size .iso files.

To see your version enter:

iso-read --version

The iso-read and iso-info command line utilities come from the
"Compact Disc Input and Control Library" often packaged as "libcdio",
but also as "libcdio-utils", and available in distros.

Mac host:

MacPorts for Mac OS X at the time of this writing provides version 0.92.
You may need to tell your MacPorts to selfupdate and upgrade outdated.
See the enclosed Mac OS X specific documentation file for instructions.

RHEL host:

RHEL 6.x and derivatives so far have provided version 0.81,
hence much use of NrvrCommander has been without problems,
specifically if and because many .iso files are <4GB.
Unless you install 0.92, however, you cannot install from
.iso files >4GB, and you cannot install Windows.

See the enclosed RHEL specific documentation file for instructions
how to build 0.92 from the git repository of libcdio.

A version of libcdio source code that is known to work well with NrvrCommander
can be retrieved be checking out tag release-0.92 , like so:

git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/libcdio.git
cd libcdio
git checkout release-0.92

The Fedora rawhide repository has started carrying libcdio-0.92.

Ubuntu host:

Ubuntu 12.04 and 13.04 apparently provide version 0.83,
See the enclosed Ubuntu specific documentation file for instructions
how to build 0.92 from the git repository of libcdio.
